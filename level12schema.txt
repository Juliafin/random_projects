## As the user, I would like to create tasks
  * The task types are: 
    1. **Todos**
      *Standard fields
      **Due Date with datetime

    2. **Meetings**
      *For one on one or multiple-person consultations?
      *Standard fields
      *Location Field

    3. **Phone Calls**
      *Standard fields
      *Phone number
      *Conference number
      *Video conference URL
      *Date

  * The default task is **Todos**
  * Changing the task type between **Meetings** and **Phone Calls** should not result in loss of data (Should not affect schema?)
  * The standard task fields are:
     1. **Title** 
     2. **Description**
     3. **Status** (*Unstarted*, *Archived*, *Completed*, *In Progress*)
     4. **Date** (specific *datetime*, not just date)
     5. **Priority** (*Low*, *Medium*, *High* )
  * Archived tasks are only visible in *View Archived Tasks* view
  * Tasks may have multiple assignees, with one being designated as primary
  * Tasks may only be assigned to someone in a given user's department
  * Tasks may be associated with a contact

## As the user, I would like to edit tasks
  * The editable fields are **Description**, **Assignee(s)**, and fields specific to each task
  * In the edit view, tasks (of all types) may be archived

* Additional considerations: Tasks may be split into multiple tables and referenced into a generic tasks table that contains fields common to all of the tasks, however I thought that this would cause a lot of field duplication.
