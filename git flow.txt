master - production grade code! (release quality)

|

development (beta grade code) - should be stable, but can have small issues

|

feature/bugfix banches - (alpha grade code) - unstable (incomplete work)


1. Pull from development (get the latest code)
2. Checkout from development - making feature/bugfix branch
3a. Merge and pull development into your branch (resolve any conflicts) 
3b. Once feature branch is stable and tested, pull request to development
4. Two people test and review locally (on your branch) if it's good, approve and merge
5. Test again in development - if it's good, merge to master
